## Design

> :bulb: **TIP:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.


### Architecture

<div align="center">
  <a href="https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-4/tp">
    <img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="90%"/>
  </a>
<h5 align="center"> 1.1. Architecture Diagram</h5>
</div>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.


Given below is a quick overview of Main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of five components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.
* [`CommandManager`](#command-manager-component): Receives commands from the logic component and handles its execution/un-execution appropriately.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command delete 1.

<div align="center">
  <a href="https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-4/tp">
    <img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="90%"/>
  </a>
<h5 align="center">Architecture Sequence Diagram (Delete command)</h5>
</div>

Each of the five main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an interface with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete {Component Name}Manager class (which follows the corresponding API interface mentioned in the previous point.

> :bulb: Eg. The Model component defines its API in the Model.java interface and implements its functionality using the ModelManager.java class which follows the Model interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

The following section gives more details of each component.

### Components

<div align="center">
  <a href="https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-4/tp">
    <img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="90%" />
  </a>
<h5 align="center">Component Managers</h5>
</div>

#### **The UI Component**

**API** : [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<div align="center">
  <a href="https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-4/tp">
    <img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="90%" />
  </a>
<h5 align="center">UI Class Diagram</h5>
</div>

The UI consists of a MainWindow that is made up of parts e.g.CommandBox, ResultDisplay, PersonListPanel, StatusBarFooter etc. All these, including the MainWindow, inherit from the abstract UiPart class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The UI component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching .fxml files that are in the src/main/resources/view folder. For example, the layout of the [MainWindow](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [MainWindow.fxml](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The UI component,

* executes user commands using the Logic component.
* listens for changes to Model data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the Logic component, because the UI relies on the Logic to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the Model component, as it displays Person object residing in the Model.

> :memo: **NOTE** The Command Manager component is not reflected in the diagram since there are no direct dependencies with the UI component

#### **The Logic Component**

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<div align="center">
  <a href="https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-4/tp">
    <img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="90%" />
  </a>
<h5 align="center">Logic Class Diagram (Partial)</h5>
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `CommandManager` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

<div align="center">

    <img src="images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png" width="90%" />
  </a>
<h5 align="center">Delete Command Sequence Diagram</h5>
</div>

> :memo: **NOTE:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<div align="center">
  <a href="https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-4/tp">
    <img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="90%" />
  </a>
<h5 align="center">Parser Class Diagram</h5>
</div>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

#### **The CommandManageable Component**

**API** : [`CommandManageable.java`](https://github.com/eugenechiaay/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/CommandManageable.java)

<div align="center">
  <a href="https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-4/tp">
    <img src="images/CMClassDiagram.png" width="90%" />
  </a>
<h5 align="center">CM Class Diagram</h5>
</div>

The `CommandManageable` component,

* receives command objects from the `Logic` component e.g. a `DeleteCommand`.
* keeps track of commands and states in a stack.
* any `UndoCommand` or `RedoCommand` it receives will be processed differently from other commands.
* a component between logic and model, commands are executed and un-execute here.

> :bulb: **COOL:** The Command Manager component was built as a means to support the newly implemented undo and redo functions!

#### **The Model Component**

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<div align="center">
  <a href="https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-4/tp">
    <img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="90%" />
  </a>
<h5 align="center">Model Class Diagram</h5>
</div>

The `Model` component,

* stores the NUSearch data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

>:memo: **NOTE:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<div align="center">
  <a href="https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-4/tp">
    <img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="90%" />
  </a>
<h5 align="center">Better Model Class Diagram</h5>
</div>

#### **The Storage Component**

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<div align="center">
  <a href="https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-4/tp">
    <img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="90%" />
  </a>
<h5 align="center">Storage Class Diagram</h5>
</div>

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

### Add Person feature

This section describes how a `Person` object is added to the list of Contacts.

**Implementation**

A `Person` object in NUSearch consists of `Name`, `Phone`, `Faculty`, `Email`, `Role`, `Faculty`, `Tag`, `Telegram`. The latter two fields are Optional fields.
When a `add` command is being input to the command input box, a `Person` will be added to the `UniquePersonsList`.

Here is how an example of how the `add` command behaves:

1. The user inputs - `add n/Shurvir Arora p/92212429 e/hello@gmail.com r/Professor f/Science t/Hello tele/@Shuvy123`.
2. The user's input is received by the `LogicManager` class and passed into the `parseCommand` method of the `AddressBookParser` class.
3. In the `parseCommand` method, the `add` command format is being matched.
5. An `AddCommand` object is created using the user's input as arguments.
6. The `AddCommand` object is then returned to the `LogicManager` class and then passed to the `CommandManager` class.
7. The `AddCommand` is executed in the `CommandManager` class, whereby a `Person` object with the given fields is constructed and added to the `UniquePersonsList`.

**Sequence Diagram**

The given sequence diagram shows the execution of the feature.

  </a>
<h5 align="center">Add Activity Diagram</h5>
</div>

### Favourite/Un-favourite Person Feature

This section describes how a `Person` object is "favourited" or "Un-favourited".

**Implementation**

Apart from the fields stated above, a `Person` object also has a `Favourite` boolean field to indicate whether a person is a favourite one or not.

Here is how an example of how the `fav` command behaves:

1. The user inputs - `fav 1`.
2. The user's input is received by the `LogicManager` class and passed into the `parseCommand` method of the `AddressBookParser` class.
3. In the `parseCommand` method, the `fav` command format is being matched.
4. A `FavouriteCommand` object is created using the user's input as arguments.
5. The `FavouriteCommand` object is then returned to the `LogicManager` class and then passed to the `CommandManager` class.
6. The `FavouriteCommand` is executed in the `CommandManager` class, whereby a clone of the target `Person` is created, albeit its `Favourite` field set to true.

> The programme behaves in a similar way for  "Unfavourite" command.

### Find Person(s) by Tag Feature

This section describes how the find by `Tag` feature works.

**Implementation**

The find by`Tag` feature operates through the use of the `Predicate` class. Where a `FilteredPersonsList` is updated using a `Predicate` object.

Here is how an example of how the `tag` command behaves:

1. The user inputs - `tag friends`.
2. The user's input is received by the `LogicManager` class and passed into the `parseCommand` method of the `AddressBookParser` class.
3. In the `parseCommand` method, the `tag` command format is being matched.
4. The user's input is used to create a `Predicate` object. With this `Predicate` object, a `TagCommand` is created.
5. The `TagCommand` object is then returned to the `LogicManager` class and then passed to the `CommandManager` class.
6. The `TagCommand` is executed in the `CommandManager` class, whereby the `FilteredPersonsList` is update with the `Predicate` object.

**Sequence Diagram**

The given sequence diagram shows the execution of the feature.

### Undo/Redo Command Feature

This section describes how the Undo/Redo feature works.

**Implementation**

Here is how an example of how the `Undo/Redo` command behaves:

Example starting state with 2 states prior:

  </a>
<h5 align="center">Undo Redo Initial State Diagram</h5>
</div>

1. The user inputs - `Undo`.
2. The user's input is received by the `LogicManager` class and passed into the `parseCommand` method of the `AddressBookParser` class.
3. In the `parseCommand` method, the `undo` command format is being matched.
4. An `UndoCommand` is created.
5. The `UndoCommand` object is then returned to the `LogicManager` class and then passed to the `CommandManager` class.
6. The `UndoCommand` is executed in the `CommandManager` class, whereby the state of the `Addressbook` is updated to the previous state.

### Copy Email/Phone Number Feature

This section describes how the Copy Email/Phone Number feature works.

**Implementation**

Here is how an example of how the Copy Email/Phone Number command behaves:

1. The user inputs - `copy-email 2`.
2. The user's input is received by the `LogicManager` class and passed into the `parseCommand` method of the `AddressBookParser` class.
3. In the `parseCommand` method, the `copy-email` command format is being matched.
4. A `CopyEmailCommand` command is created.
5. The `CopyEmailCommand` object is then returned to the `LogicManager` class and then passed to the `CommandManager` class.
6. The `CopyEmailCommand` is executed in the `CommandManager` class, whereby the `Email` of a `Person` object at the specified index is copied unto the device's clipboard.

## **Appendix**

**Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* Has a need to manage a significant number of contacts
* Prefers desktop apps over other types
* Can type fast
* Prefers typing to mouse interactions
* Is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: manage NUS contacts faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app


### User stories

Priorities: High (must have) - `* * *`, Medium (nice to have) - `* *`, Low (unlikely to have) - `*`
